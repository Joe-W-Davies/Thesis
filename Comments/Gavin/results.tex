General 
add a section for stats - could be here or maybe in the S+B chapter

refer to an explicit appendix when it is ready

P13
add a comment for the figure, and also add the p-value.

P15 
add a comment for the correlation matrices

P17
add a general statement in the results summary, e.g. agree with SM,
