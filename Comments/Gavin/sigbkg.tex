why do we have the gaussians? Or possibly why did we do the study of other functional forms?
explain/check the number of parameters
discuss the interpolation plots

the paragraph explaining what is done in the 2NLL fit needs to be moved. 
probably best to move to the introduction of the chapter?

P6
give range of values of bkg events under the peak

P7 
increase size of text in plots
consider order of uncertainty listing?

P10
explain how the uncertainties are derived in more detail
