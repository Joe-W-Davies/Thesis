%To keep in mind for later

"The LHC design parameters allow for proton-proton collisions to occur at a maximum centre-of-mass energy of 14\,TeV"
Now final so not really correct to say "allow for"?

Consistency between b quarks and b jets.

References for tracker and other subdetectors.

Why is the ECAL crystal shape and alignment as is (tapered and pseudo-projective)?

Form (and calculations?) of the ECAL energy resolution parameterisation.

Check if the detector buffer is stored on detector (question relates to whether it's valid to say they are sent off-detector).

Why only muon referenced/skewed in the CMS cross-section image?

Add a diagram explaining the trigger system.

Add some info on the typical CMS data-taking efficiency; could do this by changing the lumi diagram to show difference between delivered and recorded.

Ensure consistency in names across references.
