P2
does the SM only represent the fundamental constituents of matter? Or sth else as well?

P4
Q - why 8 and not 9 generators it's bc you get N^2 - 1 generators for SU(N)
Q - why does QCD increase with distance and result in jets etc?

P7
add a diagram of the Higgs potential and SSB

P9 onwards
need to restruture the properties section. 
After the overview (first paragraph), 
start with a purely theoretical description of the production and decays, 
and appropriately reference the experimental papers where they are discovered.
Then give a more general and logical description of the Higgs boson properties. 
Start with spin and mass, then move on to couplings. 
Describe the traditional signal strength measurements, and the kappa framework. 
This then leads on to the STXS framework, 
the motivation for which (and that for the binning) should be clearly stated when it is introduced.
