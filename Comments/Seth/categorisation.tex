Page 1: In general, you have space to explain your cuts. 
For the scaled pts you can point out that you explain on the later page. 
You can also state explicitly what goes wrong in the barrel-endcap transition regions.

Page 2:  You have room to comment on the ttH selection, 
especially how many events are removed and qualitatively how it worked, 
rather than just refering to the other note.

For gluon fusion categorization, 
this should really be defined in the theory chapter and then referred to here.  

Page 3: Be very very explicit on how the reco-level bins are defined 
and how they match the cuts on the reco objects to the gen-level bins.

Page 5: How is sigma_vtx computed? 

Page 6: How is this weight applied exactly? 
Usually we talk about upweighting or downweighting events 
so the MVA training pays attention to them, but that doesn't seem to be what's described here...

You have room to explain briefly how BDT's (including training/boosting) work 
and what the hyperparameters are, including showing some results of the optimisation.

Page 9: Unless I missed it, you don't explicitly say that the "expected significance" in the tables 
and other parts of the optimisation procedure is the AMS. 
Also do you ever combine the AMS for multiple bins in quadrature to evaluate things? 
If so say this clearly.
