\caption{
  Data points (black) and signal plus background model fit for the sum of all categories is shown. 
  Each category is weighted by S/(S + B), 
  where S and B are the numbers of expected signal and background events, respectively, 
  in a $\pm 1 \seff$ mass window centered on \mH. 
  The one standard deviation (green) and two standard deviation (yellow) bands 
  include the uncertainties in the background component of the fit. 
  The solid red line shows the contribution from the total signal, plus the background contribution. 
  The dashed red line shows the contribution from the background component of the fit. 
  The bottom plot shows the residuals after subtraction of this background component.

  Each row therefore sums to 100\%.

  The results of a two-parameter fit in the STXS framework,

  All ggH are grouped together in the fit to form one parameter,

  The results of a thirteen-parameter fit in the STXS framework. 
  The two VBF-like ggH bins are grouped to form one parameter,

  No further merging is performed. 
  The ggH parameters include bbH components, 
  while the qqH parameters include the hadronic VH contribution. 
  The ttH, tH and VH leptonic processes are constrained to the SM prediction. 
  Cross section ratios are shown with approximate 68\% CL intervals (black points) 
  and compared to the SM expectations and their uncertainties (blue bands). 
  The cross section ratios are constrained to be non-negative, 
  as indicated by the vertical line and hashed pattern. 
  The parameters whose best-fit values are at zero are known to have 68\% CL intervals 
  which slightly under-cover; this is checked using pseudo-experiments. 
  The compatibility of this fit with the SM prediction, 
  expressed as a p-value with respect to the SM, is approximately 18\%.
