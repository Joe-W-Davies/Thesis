\section{Introduction}
The principal aim of this analysis is to measure Higgs boson simplified template cross sections, 
at both stage 0 and stage 1, and their associated uncertainties.
This is achieved by performing a simultaneous fit of the signal and background models 
(described in Chapter~\ref{chap:sigbkg}) to the observed \mgg distribution in each category.
A binned maximum likelihood fit is performed in the range $100 < \mgg < \SI{180}{GeV}$, 
with a bin size of \SI{250}{MeV};
this is sufficiently small relative to the diphoton mass resolution 
that a negligible amount of information is lost. %and is computationally much faster

The likelihood function in each category, $\Like_c$, is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\Like_c(\Largs) = \prod^{N_b}_{i=1} \textrm{Poisson}\left( m_{\gamma\gamma,i}\,|\, 
                  s_i(\vec{x},\mH,\vec{\theta}) + b_i(\vec{\theta}) \right) \times C(\vec{\theta})
\end{equation}
where: $\vec{x}$ is the set of parameters of interest (POIs), 
which in this analysis are always a set of one or more cross section parameters;
$\vec{\theta}$ is the set of nuisance parameters which affect the measurements 
but do are not themselves of interest;
$N_b$ is the number of bins used in the category's \mgg distribution;
Poisson indicates a Poisson function evaluated with the observed number of events 
in the $i^{\mathit{th}}$ bin $m_{\gamma\gamma,i}$ 
and expected number of events given by the sum of the signal expectation $s_i$ 
and the background expectation $b_i$;
$C(\vec{\theta})$ is the constraint term penalising deviations 
from the expected value in the case of signal nuisance parameters
and model complexity in the nuisance parameters affecting the background.
The expected number of signal events in each bin depends on the POIs, \mH, 
and the nuisance parameters, 
whilst the expected number of background events depends only on nuisance parameters.

The total likelihood \Like is then given by the product of the likelihoods over all categories:
\begin{equation}
\Like(\Largs) = \prod^{N_c}_{c=1} \Like_c(\Largs)
\end{equation}
where $N_c$ is the total number of analysis categories.
The fit is then performed by minimising the value of the negative log-likelihood, \NLL, where
\begin{equation}
\NLL = -2\ln\Like(\Largs)
\end{equation}
The free parameters in the fit are parameters of interest, \mH, and the background nuisance parameters;
the signal nuisance parameters can vary but are constrained by their uncertainty values.
The \NLL is constructed and minimised numerically within the RooFit~\cite{RooFit} 
software package for statistical data analysis.
The values of the parameters for the minimum 2NLL are then described as the ``best-fit" values.

A frequentist approach is followed in order to extract the uncertainties on the POIs, 
in addition to their best-fit values.
The likelihood ratio test statistic is constructed for a range of POI values, where:
\begin{equation}
\dNLL = -2\ln\frac{\Like(\Largs)}{\Like(\mgg\,|\,\vec{\hat{x}},\hat{m}_H,\vec{\hat{\theta}})}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\hat{x}}$, $\hat{m}_H$, and $\vec{\hat{\theta}}$ are the best-fit values 
of the POIs, Higgs boson mass, and nuisance parameters respectively.
The distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic 
can then be used to infer the approximate uncertainties on the measurements.
For a sufficient number of events, %in each bin??
the distribution tends to that of a $\chi^2$~\cite{Asymptotic}, with the number of degrees of freedom
equal to the number of POIs being measured.
In this case, it can be shown that the 68\% confidence level (CL) intervals 
are given approximately by the region where $\dNLL < 1$.
The interpretation of the 68\% CL intervals within the frequentist paradigm 
is that in an ensemble of identical pseudo-experiments, 
the observed best-fit value of the POI should fall within the intervals in 68\% of cases.
The crossing points of the \dNLL at $\pm 1$ are therefore considered 
as the 68\% CL uncertainties on the POI in question.

In this analysis the POIs considered are Higgs boson simplified template cross sections, 
which are defined at various levels of granularity and denoted by the symbol $\sigma$.
The so-called ``stage 0" cross sections are equivalent 
to the sum of the individual stage 1 cross sections.
This makes clear that parameters can be defined as sums of different STXS bins, 
not just individual bins themselves.
Measuring a wider set of STXS bins provides more information, 
but the uncertainties are correspondingly larger than if fewer parameters are measured.
Therefore in this section results are reported under various scenarios, 
with between one and thirteen POIs in total.
In most cases, the results are displayed as the cross section divided by the SM prediction. 
This is only to improve the readability and ease of comparison with the SM;
the underlying parameter is the cross section.
This differs from a signal strength, the ratio of the observed cross section 
to the SM prediction, normally denoted by:
\begin{equation}
\mu = \sigma / \sigmaSM
\end{equation}
because in the measurement of $\mu$ 
the uncertainty on the SM prediction must be considered in the fit. 
In contrast, the STXS measurements do not include these uncertainties on the SM yield.
This ensures the measurements are as independent as possible of the SM prediction, 
and means they remain useful if the theory uncertainties improve in the future.

In the following section, the observed diphoton mass distribution
and the composition of the analysis categories are presented.
The remainder of chapter describes the results of stage 0 and stage 1 measurements 
within the STXS framework.
All results were first reported in Ref.~\cite{HIG-18-029}.

  Data points (black) and signal plus background model fit for the sum of all categories is shown. 
  Each category is weighted by S/(S + B), 
  where S and B are the numbers of expected signal and background events, respectively, 
  in a $\pm 1 \seff$ mass window centred on \mH. 
  The one standard deviation (green) and two standard deviation (yellow) bands 
  include the uncertainties in the background component of the fit. 
  The solid red line shows the contribution from the total signal, plus the background contribution. 
  The dashed red line shows the contribution from the background component of the fit. 
  The bottom plot shows the residuals after subtraction of this background component.
