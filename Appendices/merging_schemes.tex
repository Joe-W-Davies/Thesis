    Schematic showing the STXS stage 1.0 binning definition. Here, the ggH, qqH and VH leptonic production modes are split by the event kinematics for the first time. The ``VBF cuts" require the dijet invariant mass, $m_{jj}>400$~GeV, and the difference in pseudorapidity between the jets, $\Delta\eta_{jj}>2.8$. The ``VH cuts" require $60<m_{jj}<120$~GeV.

    Schematic showing the STXS stage 1.1 binning definition. The ggH and qqH binnings are significantly revised with respect to the stage 1.0 scheme. Additionally the VH leptonic bins include an extra splitting at $p_T^V=75$~GeV.

    Schematic showing the STXS stage 1.2 binning definition. With respect to the stage 1.1 scheme, the ggH BSM region with $p_T^H>200$~GeV is split into four bins according to $p_T^H$ boundaries. Also, the ttH production mode is split here for the first time, into five separate $p_T^H$ bins.
