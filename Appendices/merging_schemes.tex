\chapter{Evolution of the STXS framework}\label{app:merging_schemes}
This Appendix demonstrates the evolution of the STXS framework by providing a schematic of each STXS stage. The stages are defined to accommodate increasing statistics, in the sense that with more p-p collision data, we become sensitive to increasingly granular regions of the Higgs boson production phase space. Therefore, subsequent stages are defined with more kinematic bins. The stage 0, stage 1.0 and stage 1.1 schemes are relevant for the EFT interpretation in Chapter~\ref{chap:eft}, which combines cross sections measurements from multiple decay channels at these stages. The \Hgg analysis in Chapters~\ref{chap:hgg_overview}--\ref{chap:hgg_results} is based on the stage 1.2 binning scheme.

    Schematic showing the STXS stage 1.0 binning definition. Here, the ggH, qqH and VH leptonic production modes are split by the event kinematics for the first time. The ``VBF cuts" require the dijet invariant mass, $m_{jj}>400$~GeV, and the difference in pseudorapidity between the jets, $\Delta\eta_{jj}>2.8$. The ``VH cuts" require $60<m_{jj}<120$~GeV.
