  \caption[Confusion matrix for the full set of analysis categories]
  {
    Confusion matrix displaying the composition of each analysis category in terms of a reduced set of STXS bins. The colour scale indicates the fractional yield in each category (rows) accounted for by each STXS process (columns). Each row therefore sums to 100\%. Entries with values less than 0.5\% are not shown. Simulated events for each year in the period 2016-2018 are combined with appropriate weights corresponding to their relative integrated luminosity in data. The column labelled as qqH rest includes the contributions from the qqH 0J, qqH 1J, qqH $m_{jj}<60$~GeV and the qqH $120<m_{jj}<350$~GeV STXS bins.

  \caption[Efficiency times acceptance matrix from 2016 simulation]
  {
    A matrix showing the $\epsilon^{i,\gamma\gamma}_{k}$ terms for a reduced set of STXS bins, derived from 2016 simulation. The numbers corresponds to the fraction of the total yield of STXS bin, $i$, landing in analysis category, $k$, expressed as a percentage. Each column therefore sums to 100\%. Entries with values less than 0.05\% are not shown. The bottom row indicates the fraction of events which do not enter a single analysis category. The column labelled as qqH rest includes the contributions from the qqH 0J, qqH 1J, qqH $m_{jj}<60$~GeV and the qqH $120<m_{jj}<350$~GeV STXS bins.
