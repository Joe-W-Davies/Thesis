\section{The treatment of $m_Z$ in the HEL interpretation}
The nominal HEL model is uniquely defined by the input parameters: $m_W$, $\alpha_{\rm{EM}}$ and $G_F$, where $m_W$ is the W boson mass, $\alpha_{\rm{EM}}$ is the electromagnetic coupling constant, and $G_F$ is the Fermi constant. In this input parameter scheme, the Z boson mass, $m_Z$, is dependent on the HEL parameters, $c_T$, $c_{WW}$, $c_B$ and $c_A$, according to equation \ref{eq:hel_mz},

\begin{equation}\label{eq:hel_mz}
    m_Z^2(\vec{c}) = m_{Z,\rm{SM}}^2 \Big[ 1-c_T+\frac{8\,c_A\,\sin^4(\theta_W)+2\,c_{WW}\,\cos^2(\theta_W)+c_B\,\sin^2(\theta_W)}{\cos^2(\theta_W)} \Big],
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $m_{Z,\rm{SM}}$ is the Z boson mass in the SM, and $\theta_W$ is the Weinberg angle. In the interpretation documented in this thesis, the HEL model has been adapted to remove the $\vec{c}$ dependence of $m_Z$, and instead fix it's value to the SM prediction. This reflects the fact that, although there is no explicit Z boson mass measurement entering the combination, it is well measured experimentally and therefore it is not physical to consider large variations in it's value. In fact, the chosen operator subset, $\{\mathcal{O}\}$, does not include $\mathcal{O}_T$, and $\mathcal{O}_{WW}$ and $\mathcal{O}_B$ are fit together in the combination of parameters, $c_{WW}-c_B$, which equation \ref{eq:hel_mz} does not explicitly depend on. The operator $\mathcal{O}_A$ is included in the subset, however the $c_A$ dependence is small ($\propto \sin^4(\theta_W)$), such that over the allowed range in $c_A$ there is a negligible shift in the $m_Z$ value, well within it's measured uncertainty. All in all, this means the treatment of $m_Z$ in the interpretation has a negligible effect on the measured parameters of interest.
