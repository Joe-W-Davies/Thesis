    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Longitudinal shower shape variables}} \\ \hline
    Weighted RMS($z$) & Energy weighted RMS of trigger cell $z$ co-ordinate, evaluated over the whole cluster. Measure of the longitudinal spread of the shower. \\
    First layer & First layer of the HGCAL with an energy deposit (above the trigger cell threshold). \\
    Max layer &  Layer of the HGCAL with maximum cluster energy deposit. \\
    Shower length & Total length of the cluster calculated as the difference between the first layer and the last layer with an energy deposit. \\
    Core shower length & Maximum number of consecutive layers with energy deposits in the cluster. \\
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Lateral shower shape variables}} \\ \hline
    Weighted RMS($r$) & Energy weighted RMS of trigger cell $r$ co-ordinate, evaluated over the whole cluster. The $r$ co-ordinate is divided by the $z$ co-ordinate in the calculation to account for the spreading out of the shower as it propagates through the HGCAL. Measure of the radial spread of the shower. \\
    Mean layer weighted RMS($r$) & Energy weighted RMS of trigger cell $r$ co-ordinate, evaluated for each layer separately, and averaged over the whole cluster. Again, the $r$ co-ordinate is divided by the $z$ co-ordinate to account for the spreading out of the shower. Measure of the radial spread of the shower. \\
    Weighted RMS($\eta$) & Energy weighted RMS of trigger cell $\eta$ co-ordinate, evaluated over the whole cluster. Measure of the polar angle spread of the shower. \\
    Weighted RMS($\phi$) & Energy weighted RMS of trigger cell $\phi$ co-ordinate, evaluated over the whole cluster. Measure of the azimuthal spread of the shower.\\
